#This is a specific way to grab the sides of the board. The issue is that the
#functions are gigantic. So, I thought they needed their own file

#If the game is in the form:
#       [--WBBB--] on the board in any direction of the game,
#where the opponent can't immediatly make a move on 2G in the case above,
#then it's a free XSquare that can't be hoped. If they try to hop the turn after
# then the other team will be giving up a free corner. This situation comes up a ton
#so I thought it should be hard coded in here.
